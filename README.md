# Festival 2024

For organizing the 2024 edition of the annual Research Bazaar Arizona festival. The seventh so far!

To see where all the action is happening, have a look at the [Discussions](https://github.com/resbazaz/festival2024/discussions) and the [Festival 2024 Planning Project](https://github.com/orgs/resbazaz/projects/11) in this repository.

We're looking for ideas and suggestions, so don't be shy.
